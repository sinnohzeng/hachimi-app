- Each row: mini `CatSprite` (~40px) | habit name | streak badge | today's progress bar | "Start" button
- "Start" → FocusSetupScreen(habitId)
- Today's progress bar fills as minutes accumulate vs `goalMinutes`

**Empty State** (no habits):

- Reminder time chips: `[7 AM] [8 AM] [9 PM] [None]`
- "Next" `FilledButton` (validates name is non-empty)

### Step 2 — Adopt Your Cat

### Step 3 — Name Your Cat
